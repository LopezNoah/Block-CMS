/*
Each layout has to have defined zones.
Each slot has to be predefined and cannot be built at runtime.
    Slots cannot have dynamic names
    An alternative is knowing all the possible slots that a page can have at build-time

Each Layout has associated Zones.
    By technicality, the Layouts have associated Pages and Blocks too.

This can be done later and is not the core piece of the project.
